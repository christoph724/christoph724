## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer with 7+ years of extensive experience in the design, development, coding, and testing of applications and websites.

My personal project are not visible on GitHub since I developed the project with NDA signing in private.

I'm always learning new stuff, reading some book.

Now, I'm actively looking for a new opportunity...
